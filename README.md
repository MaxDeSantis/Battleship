# Battleship
This was completed as an honors contract for my Java 1 course. It was my first foray into Java development
and largest software-exclusive project.

## Description
As can be guessed, the purpose was to recreate the classic board game "Battleship". It was to have a user-friendly
GUI and was to be played by two competing humans in multiplayer. I used the Java Swing, AWT, and net libraries to do
so.
