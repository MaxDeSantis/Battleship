# Battleship
This was completed as an honors contract for my Java 1 course. It was my first foray into Java development
and largest software-exclusive project.

## Description
As can be guessed, the purpose was to recreate the classic board game "Battleship". It was to have a user-friendly
GUI and was to be played by two competing humans in multiplayer. I used the Java Swing, AWT, and net libraries to do
so.

## Features
1. Multiplayer networking (enter other player's IP address)
2. Two-way text chat
3. Full ship placement
4. Hit/miss notifications each turn
5. Displays remaining ship pieces when you lose
6. Option to rematch after game ends
7. Everything shown in GUI that resembles the board game.
